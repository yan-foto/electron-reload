# electron reload
This is (*hopefully*) the simplest way to load contents of all active [`BrowserWindow`s](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md) within electron when the source files are changed.

**Disclaimer**: this module is in its very early stages and the logic is still not mature enough.

# Installation
```
npm install electron-reload
```

# Usage
Just initialize this module with desired glob or file path to watch and let it refresh electron browser windows as targets are changed:

```js
'use strict';

const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron');

require('electron-reload')(__dirname);

// Standard stuff
app.on('ready', () {
  let mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600});

  mainWindow.loadUrl(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`);
  // the rest...
});
```

Not that the above code only refreshes `WebContent`s of all `BrowserWindow`s. So if you want to have a hard reset (starting a new electron process) you can just pass the path to the electron executable in the `options` object. For example if you already have electron pre-built installed you could just do

```js
require('electron-reload')(__dirname, {
  electron: require('electron-prebuilt')
});
```

You could also use the (relatively) new [`electron`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) package, *but* you should specify the path directly (no `require`!):

```js
const path = require('path')

require('electron-reload')(__dirname, {
  electron: path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', '.bin', 'electron')
});
```

If your app overrides some of the default `quit` or `close` actions (e.g. closing the last app window hides the window instead of quitting the app) then the default `electron-reload` hard restart could leave you with multiple instances of your app running. In these cases you can change the default hard restart action from `app.quit()` to `app.exit()` by specifying the hard reset method in the electron-reload options:

```js
const path = require('path')

require('electron-reload')(__dirname, {
  electron: path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', '.bin', 'electron'),
  hardResetMethod: 'exit'
});
```

# API
`electron_reload(paths, options)`
* `paths`: a file, directory or glob pattern to watch
* `options` (optional):  See [options](#options)

# Options

#### electron
`string`  
Path to electron

#### singleURL
`string`  
If single url is passed, instead of reloading on change we load this url.  
This is useful if you wrap Electron around an SPA that handles it's own routing.

Everything else is passed to [`chokidar`](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) with the default addition of
```js
{
  ignored: /node_modules|[\/\\]\./
}
```

# Why this module?
Simply put, I was tired and confused by all other available modules which are so complicated\* for such an uncomplicated task!

\* *e.g. start a local HTTP server, publish change events through a WebSocket, etc.!*

# Changelog
 - **1.1.0**: Add `app.exit()` in addition to `app.quit()` for hard resets
 - **1.0.3**: Fix hard reset bug
 - **1.0.2**: Detach child so that killing parent doesn't kill it (on windows)
 - **1.0.1**: Replace `extend` with `Object.assign`
 - **1.0.0**: Adapt to Electron 1.0 new API
 - **0.3.0**: Use new method of accessing `app` (e.g. `require(electron).app`)
